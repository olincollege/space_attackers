# Introduction
This is the repository hosting a space invaders game by Gibson and Conan

The goal of the project is to create a Space Invaders clone using the modules
and game development tools provided by the pygame library. The project will
follow a Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture, with real-time input from
the player. We chose to make a game in the Arcade Space Shooter genre, as we
thought that it would not be as often-chosen as something like a platformer
or isometric RPG, and we were fans of the aesthetic associated with games in
the genre.

THe other required dependency is the `random` library.To install it run  `$ pip install random`
